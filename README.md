This project was created with React, Redux, and the new React hooks for functional components. This project gave me a base knowledge of the core React functionalities and most popular libraries. Some things this project implements are:

- [x] Rendering JSX and how it works behind the scenes (rather than being "syntactical sugar")
- [x] Basic React concepts such as class based and functional components, props, and component lifecycles. 
- [x] Refactored the project to use functional components and hooks. I had originally finished this project with class based stateful components and moved to experiment with the new React hooks to use stateful functional components.
- [x] More experience with Javascript methods such as filter, map, and reduce
- [x] Styling with React 
- [x] Using a data store to GET and POST to (Firebase)
- [x] Routing
- [x] Form validation through React functionality
- [x] Redux for state management (dispatching actions, reducers, etc.)
- [x] More advanced Redux (middleware, asynchronous code, etc.)

Although I will continue to learn more and more about React, this project gave me a great understanding on how state management works and the different methods to achieve it.
